This Java application shows how every point in the Mandelbrot set corresponds to a different Julia set.  It lets you move the mouse over an image of the Mandelbrot set in the left pane of the window and see the corresponding Julia set in the right pane.  The Julia set updates in real time with your mouse movements, which creates some beautiful animated pictures.  

Using arrow keys, you can zoom into both panes to a very high resolution.  Clicking with the mouse recentres the Mandelbrot set around the point of the mouse click, at the same resolution.  In this way, you can zoom into a particular point of the Mandelbrot set and make some startling discoveries about its fractal properties.
